# Hello there 👋
Hi, I'm Arthur DUCEPT, a software developer with a passion for the art of well-designed code. My goal? To become an accomplished software architect. I love immersing myself in clean code, clean architecture, design patterns and all the best practices that make development both an art and a science.
<br><br>

## 🔭 Current projects

I'm currently working on several backend and frontend development projects.  
I'm also immersing myself in microservices architectures.
<br><br>

## 🌱 Skills

Languages : JavaScript, Java, Dart  
Frameworks : Node, Vue, React, Flutter, Angular, Spring Boot  
Tools : Docker, CI/CD  
Methodologies : Agile, TDD
<br><br>

## 📚 Continuous learning

Actuellement, je me forme aux différentes pratiques d'architecture logicielle.  
Je suis toujours à la recherche de ressources pour maîtriser les principes SOLID et le TDD.
<br><br>

## 🎧 Apart from the code

I'm a big fan of music, so don't hesitate to share your playlists with me!  
Formula 1? Count me in! There's nothing like a good Grand Prix to spice up the weekend.
